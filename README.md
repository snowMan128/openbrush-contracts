**A Rust library for secure smart contract development on ink!.** 

This library contains traits definition of standard tokens. 
Everyone who implements these traits will have the same API during cross contract calls.
Also the library provides default implementation on Rust level
([issue](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/issues/5) describes why) 
which can be reused or customized by everyone.

To understand how to use the library better to check [examples](examples) and [doc](doc) folders.

üöÄ Our mission with this project is to make ink! really usable.


## Overview

### Installation

### Usage 


### ink! version
At the moment library is using own version of ink!, but it is the same as [ink!-3.0-rc3](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/releases/tag/v3.0.0-rc3)
with additional fixes:
- [Not generate metadata if compile_as_dependency is true](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/811)
- [Remove Salt in code generation during build_create](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/842)
- [A new `metadata_name` attribute](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/859)

### Events 
‚ÄºÔ∏è Important ‚ÄºÔ∏è

Events are not supported currently due to how ink! currently handles them.  
The identifiers of events must be based on the name of the trait. At the moment, ink! doesn't support it,
but it must be fixed with this [issue](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/issues/809). 

### The library is not production-ready, these issues must be resolved first:
* [Standard token naming convention](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/issues/1)
* [Event's identifiers are based on the naming of the storage structure](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/issues/2)

### Usage of the library looks not pretty, but it will be simplified with resolving issues:
* [Returning of error doesn't mean revert of transaction](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/issues/3)
* [#[ink::trait_definition] doesn't support generics and default implementation](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/issues/4)
* [Library provides implementation on Rust level instead of ink! level](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/issues/5)
* [List of issues, solving each of them can simplify usage of library](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/issues/8)

The upgradable contract will be available after resolving of this [issue](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/issues/7)

## Roadmap üöó
------- Release 0.1.0
- [x] Implement fungible, non-fungible, and multi tokens.
- [x] Implement AccessControl and Ownable.
- [x] Add examples of how to reuse ERC20, ERC721, AccessControl implementations.
- [x] Stub implementations for `token` and `access` folders.
- [x] Add base description of project

------- Release 0.2.0
- [x] Remove the boilerplate to make the internal implementation external.
- - [x] Implement `brush::contract` macro to consume all brush's stuff before ink!.
- - [x] Implement `brush::trait_definition` which stores definition of trait and allow to use it in `brush::contract` macro.
- - [x] Implement `impl_trait!` macro which reuse internal implementation in external impl section.
- [x] Refactor examples and tests with new macros.
- [x] Decide how to handle errors and implement it in library(Decided to use `panic!` and `assert!`).

------- Release 0.3.0
- [x] Create derive macro for storage traits. This macro must adds fields to contract's struct.
- [x] Cover all contracts with unit tests and integration tests.
- [x] Create documentation based on readme. Add comments to macros with example of usage.
- [x] Add `Ownable` + `ERC1155` example.
- [x] Support simple modifiers(which can only call functions without code injection).
- [x] Instead of `impl_trait!` macro add support of default implementation in external trait definition. 
  Users can define default implementation in traits and macro will copy/paste this implementation during the generation of the contract.

------- Release 1.0.0  
- [ ] Finalize PSP for fungible tokens. Refactor of implementation.  
- [x] Support code injection in modifiers. 
- [x] Implement a reentrancy guard and example of usage.  
- [ ] Add more examples and documentation on how to use the library.

------- Pre-release 2.0.0
- [ ] PSPs for NFT and multi-token.
- [ ] Add extensions: AccessControlEnumerable, ERC721Enumerable.
- [ ] Refactor NFT and multi-token according to final decisions in PSPs.


------- Release 2.0.0 - Production ready
- [ ] Force/help ink! to create new independent events. During this task decide how ink! can generate metadata for events/traits from other crates.
- [ ] Cover everything with UT and integration tests.
- [ ] More documentation and examples.
- [ ] Audit.

------- Release 3.0.0
- [ ] All extensions for tokens(Pausable, TimeLockController and etc).
- [ ] Improve ink! to allow code injection to have default implementation on ink! level instead Rust level.
- [ ] Refactor the library according to new changes.

------- Release 4.0.0
- [ ] Add support of upgradable contracts to ink!/contract-pallet level.
- [ ] Create upgradable contracts.

## FAQ

### Why IntelliJ rust plugin doesn't autocomplete the library's derive macros?
It requires enabling of several experimental features:
* `org.rust.cargo.evaluate.build.scripts` - enables building and collecting build artefacts including proc-macro libraries during importing of project structure
* `org.rust.macros.proc` - enables expansion of procedural macros

To enable an experimental feature, type `Experimental feature` in the dialog of `Help | Find Action` action and enabled the corresponding item.

### Was it audited?
Contracts in this repository have not yet been audited. But it is in plans.
