## Overview

`traits` contains definitions of traits(interfaces) for the popular contracts.
Anyone can import the trait and use it to do cross-contract calls without
knowing the implementation of the contract.

That folder contains the implementation of popular contracts.
Anyone can re-use the implementation if import the `brush` crate, enable
feature of the contract, and implement all required traits.
